[00:00] This talk is titled how to scratch an itch in 200 repos
[00:03] or less. @searls is my real name
[00:06] My parents were quite prescient and on-brand back when
[00:09] they named me. This is what my face looked
[00:12] like in 2011 and thanks to personal
[00:15] branding, I'm now stuck with this face forever because you might see it
[00:18] from Twitter or Github as my avatar
[00:21] Just like Todd mentioned, I co-founded an agency with him
[00:22] Just like Todd mentioned, I co-founded an agency with him 5 years ago called
[00:25] Test Double. Our mission in life is to improve
[00:28] a lot of the stuff about software that sucks, and one of the things that sucks a lot
[00:31] is that most engineering teams operate at capacity
[00:34] and they don't have enough slack in the system to improve
[00:37] things like testing, and quality, and craft. So we come in
[00:40] to pair with those teams to add enough capacity so that
[00:43] we can all work together to make stuff better. It might sound
[00:46] familiar as a business model, it's kind of like consulting except good
[00:49] So if your team could benefit from that sort of
[00:52] thing, I hope you'll chat with me or Todd tonight or tomorrow
[00:55] So, yeah, how to scratch an itch You might be able to
[00:58] infer from that title that this is a talk about creativity
[01:01] Everyone loves creativity, "yay! creativity!" That's a good
[01:04] thing, right, ok, cool, let's talk about creativity. …So what is
[01:07] creativity, exactly? It's one of those axiomatic
[01:10] concepts that we generally don't interrogate
[01:13] or introspect much on, and I forced myself to
[01:16] think about this when I was designing this talk and
[01:19] The first thing that came to mind is that creativity is a lot like passion
[01:22] Passion's hot right now. We got all these passion projects. Look at all
[01:25] these passionate logos for passion projects that people have
[01:28] made. But personally I don't get on board with a movement
[01:31] until I can find a way to engage with a brand
[01:34] and its hashtag. So the American Express passion project.
[01:37] And it actually serves as a really good example of why
[01:40] passion doesn't equal creativity, because it fizzles out
[01:43] kind of like domain name registrations
[01:46] So the Amex passion project is just gone
[01:49] now. So, no, passion isn't quite
[01:52] what creativity is. You might say "is creativity art?"
[01:55] You certainly—coding feels creative, right?
[01:58] We know it's a creative enterprise, but not all of our
[02:01] code is art, when I put it up on a screen
[02:04] You know, it's mostly functional most of the time. It certainly can
[02:07] be art, but it doesn't seem like the best metaphor
[02:10] or abstraction. You could say, is creativity vision
[02:13] and foresight? If we had a crystal ball where you could see
[02:16] where the cloud is and where it's going to go and there might be an
[02:19] aspect of that, but that's not in itself building anything
[02:22] it's just prognostication, so vision's not enough
[02:25] And I thought about this at length to try to
[02:28] figure out, "am I creative? are you creative?"
[02:31] And if I was forced to think in those terms
[02:34] and that popular framing about creativity like filling out a survey
[02:37] Are you incredibly passionate? Do you create beautiful things?
[02:40] Can you see into the future? Of course most of us would say no
[02:43] to all three of those things, so certainly we're not
[02:46] creative. That's a really high bar to clear. Creative people
[02:49] are these magical unicorns and that's not me, that's not us.
[02:52] That's kind of disappointing. We can
[02:55] usually at least relate to the idea of a creative spark, right, like we
[02:58] have an idea in the back of our heads we're walking down the street and an
[03:01] idea occurs and then of course what happens next is we just
[03:04] effortlessly create amazing things based on that idea
[03:07] Unfortunately, that doesn't comport with my experience. Actually
[03:10] I have a—creative ideas, they stress me
[03:13] out. That spark, tells me— I'm already really busy
[03:16] how am I going to find the time or the capability to go
[03:19] and accomplish that thing
[03:22] these ideas they sort of scare me, because I don't think I'm—gonna
[03:25] have fear, uncertainty, and doubt I'm not going to be able to do them. Where does that spark
[03:28] come from? Is there some big dragon breathing fire
[03:31] behind me? Should I be running from my ideas or I'm going to burn
[03:34] up? I got this fraught relationship with these
[03:37] creative ideas in my head, and so I was thinking about my own
[03:40] weird relationship with creativity and I realized
[03:43] the best metaphor for me is that creativity is a chronic
[03:46] illness. Which I know sounds horrifying
[03:49] But here me out. Because what happens is I go two weeks
[03:52] three weeks, four weeks, and eventually something makes
[03:55] me angry, something wells up inside of me
[03:58] and then I have an episode of creativity
[04:01] and I emit a blog post or a library or a
[04:04] framework. And
[04:07] the way I think of it is it's like kidney stones
[04:10] I'm passing npm modules
[04:13] And then I feel a sense of relief
[04:16] after. So I've seen this pattern
[04:19] in my life, right? I've got all of these negative emotions, this
[04:22] toxicity. I'm a really sad, broken individual and
[04:25] over the course of my professional life I keep finding these
[04:28] ways to shape that into positive outcomes
[04:31] and I don't know how that happens, and so this talk is an exploration
[04:34] into trying to figure that out, and maybe there's something that you can
[04:37] relate to. Because what I've found is that that reframing
[04:40] of what creativity is certainly lowers the
[04:43] bar, it's like "are you a broken individual? Good! then you
[04:46] can be creative, too!" So let's
[04:49] wind all the way back to the beginning of my career
[04:52] I was working at a big accounting firm, I wasn't very
[04:55] competent. I didn't have very much autonomy
[04:58] at my job, and I would get ideas like anyone gets ideas
[05:01] But I wouldn't be able to act on those ideas, so they actually just
[05:04] bummed me out. In fact, eventually the ideas would fade away
[05:07] and that would make me feel relieved, because now they weren't stressing me
[05:10] out. And it took me years to realize that what I was missing was
[05:13] I didn't have an outlet to practice those creative ideas
[05:16] To develop a feedback loop, just like we do with coding stuff
[05:19] And I learned once I started trying that production
[05:22] wasn't necessarily the best creative outlet, either
[05:25] Us as developers working at machines
[05:28] At work, we might think that this is creativity, building
[05:31] ideas, but typically they're other people's ideas
[05:34] we're building reports, or mailers, or shopping carts
[05:37] and we feel creative, because we did create it
[05:40] but because it wasn't our own, it doesn't really scratch the same itch, I don't think
[05:43] Separately, we usually
[05:46] work on teams and an important part of building software on teams
[05:49] (there's me and that's my team)
[05:52] An important part about building software on teams is that we're building everything
[05:55] to be very consistent and orderly so that any of us can be productive
[05:58] in that environment, but creativity is sporadic
[06:01] and messy. I might have an idea like "Hey I could pull this
[06:04] one package out and that would eliminate the need for these two packages
[06:07] Because I could put a factory in front of them and look at this, and this is
[06:10] really cool and I could be really proud of the creative thing that I just did
[06:13] But from everyone else's perspective, they see the
[06:16] system is becoming less stable and less workable. And
[06:19] they're worried, and I get mad because they don't appreciate this cool
[06:22] creative thing that I just did and then they
[06:25] get angry because I keep going off the reservation and disrupting the
[06:28] orderliness of the system. A third thing that
[06:31] we see happen a lot at our company Test Double is, developers
[06:34] who are passionate about what they do, they put a lot of effort
[06:37] they tie up their ego in the stuff that \they build and then they hand it off
[06:40] they get excited and then it just sits in QA
[06:43] or people comment on their pull requests and
[06:46] and things take forever and they don't see
[06:49] it in front of users and then eventually they just get angry
[06:52] because what they did was they ceded control
[06:55] of their happiness and their emotional state to somebody else
[06:58] and at work that's just not appropriate, because we're not building
[07:01] this stuff for our own good
[07:04] we need another place to practice
[07:07] creativity. So you have to create your own space where that's
[07:10] safe. And one morning, I was
[07:13] taking a shower. Ideas come to me in the shower, I don't know when they come to you
[07:16] but they always come to me in the shower, and I had an idea and
[07:19] it made me angry, of course, because ideas are bad like I explained earlier
[07:22] and I got so mad at this idea that
[07:25] I went and sat at my computer and I hacked at it until I could build a thing
[07:28] I felt that relief again, but this relief was
[07:31] different. This was like the first green bar
[07:34] in the test. This was like "OK, cool, I understand this now"
[07:37] And I went from a disgruntled employee
[07:40] to a merely gruntled employee because I was starting to learn
[07:43] how to be productive with creativity
[07:46] And from then on when I got a creative idea
[07:49] in the shower, I'd roll my eyes because now I've gotta make time
[07:52] for this—maybe there goes my Saturday or my evening or something
[07:55] But at least I had a reasoned way to work through it
[07:58] And so ever since I started programming
[08:01] professionally, I've always had a main project that occupies most of my time
[08:04] and most of my focus, but a little project to the side. Whenever I get
[08:07] frustrated or I want to play with something or I'm learning something
[08:10] I can pull on that thread as well, and I always balance both
[08:13] of these things. Of course this comes with risks
[08:16] I'm very often burning the candle at both ends
[08:19] If I work all weekend because I'm so excited about my side project
[08:22] then I come to work on Monday morning, the last thing I want to do is program
[08:25] That can be problematic, and
[08:28] in the last several years in particular I've spent so
[08:31] much time on the road, doing all this open source stuff on top of
[08:34] my normal job, that I'm often asking "Why do I do
[08:37] this?" And that's where the introspection
[08:40] of this talk is—part of why I did this
[08:43] talk is that I don't think that I'm that special. I think all of us could be this
[08:46] creative and it would save me a lot of time if you all would
[08:49] do the talks instead of me
[08:52] So when I sat and I
[08:55] thought about why is it that I do this
[08:58] I'm almost ashamed to admit those sources
[09:01] because they're from my childhood, so I've got a few little childhood anecdotes
[09:04] The first one's about golf. My dad was actually an amateur
[09:07] golfer. One of my first memories is watching my
[09:10] dad play golf on TV at an amateur PGA event
[09:13] and so in southeastern Michigan, every well-to-do businessperson
[09:16] wanted my dad in their foursome, so I spent as a kid
[09:19] a ton of time at country clubs with kids that were way richer and
[09:22] more world-weary and experienced and knowledgeable
[09:25] and well-to-do than me
[09:28] that was an important part of my upbringing, because it taught me the
[09:31] ever-important skill of feeling inadequate
[09:37] Talk about my church a little bit I went to a church that didn't
[09:40] necessarily work in its community and serve the poor or anything
[09:43] like that. I went to an upper crust white evangelical
[09:46] Presbyterian church where I spent years 5
[09:49] through 10 of my life learning how to understand very
[09:52] intangible concepts and then feel extremely
[09:55] strongly about them and argue with passionate rhetoric
[09:58] and that was also a really important skill, because I learned
[10:01] righteous indignation. Fun fact,
[10:04] about me: nobody's ever asked for my opinion, because
[10:07] no one's ever needed to
[10:10] I can't help but form really strong opinions
[10:13] the minute I see something, and that's less fun than
[10:16] it sounds. Third thing about my life
[10:19] I'm one of those people, like at lunch we were talking about college
[10:22] programs. I got a computer science degree
[10:25] in college, and I wasn't very good at it
[10:28] My professors pulled me aside senior year when I was trying to find a job
[10:31] and some of them confided in me that maybe I should find a more
[10:34] hybrid role where I'm also talking to people more and maybe
[10:37] not trusted with a computer
[10:40] and it was through there that I learned this
[10:43] real deep-grained incompetence and
[10:46] what's funny about all those three things is that clearly they're negative but they have
[10:49] flip sides that I think are really valuable to exploit
[10:52] The inadequacy leads to me having a bunch of
[10:55] people that I aspire to in my life—that I look up to
[10:58] The indignation means that I always have something to say
[11:01] or a perspective (whether it's valid or not) and
[11:04] the incompetence means I don't view myself as a rockstar, I always
[11:07] feel like I've got a lot to learn and a lot to improve
[11:10] That translates to a means, a motive, and an opportunity
[11:13] to exploit creative ideas
[11:16] Also, worth mentioning here is this
[11:19] these are all markers of tremendous amounts of privilege in my upbringing
[11:22] most kids don't have the amount of spare time that I did to
[11:25] nurse my existential grief
[11:28] to the extent that I have, but through doing
[11:31] a lot of creative stuff, I've learned how awesome and how enriching
[11:34] and rewarding it can be. And getting back to Todd & I
[11:37] forming Test Double, a big reason we did that is because we want everyone to be
[11:40] able to have that experience by moving at a sustainable pace
[11:43] by being able to build creative stuff in a way that's congruent
[11:46] with our normal work life, so that you don't have to be
[11:49] working on nights & weekends or particularly
[11:52] privileged to be able to enjoy the fruits of creativity
[11:55] If you want to talk to us about that
[11:58] you can e-mail join@testdouble.com. Our first
[12:01] step in our recruiting process is really low-pressure, it's not some sort of
[12:04] technical interview at a white board, it's literally a conversation about
[12:07] how we work and how you work and whether you'd like to try how
[12:10] we work. Just to learn about us and learn a little bit about
[12:13] what we've learned about productive, autonomous software development
[12:16] So anyway, all these things: really negative
[12:19] How does that lead to creative ideas? Well, I
[12:22] kind of feel like it's a game of MadLibs™ in my head. This is my user
[12:25] story for creativity. I feel
[12:28] righteous indignation, but I don't know what I'm doing
[12:31] Maybe, if I build something I will feel
[12:34] less inadequate. And I have 9
[12:37] little anecdotes. 9 little stories of side projects over my career
[12:40] that have helped me to mitigate some of that toxicity
[12:43] in my heart. And I'm going to start by talking about
[12:46] incompetence. Because like I mentioned, I wasn't very good in college and
[12:49] I was really worried: why would anyone ever pay me to write software?
[12:52] when I can barely learn how to do it? And my library
[12:55] at the time where I worked said "Hey, we need a new citation editor"
[12:58] on the web. And I thought, you know, I'm
[13:01] up to this challenge. I feel like I don't need this
[13:04] Computer Science hifalutin stuff, but I also don't know how to
[13:07] build apps, either, so maybe if I build it I'll at least
[13:10] find a way to survive this profession, and it was a pretty low
[13:13] pressure gig, because it was $10 an hour and I could
[13:16] spend all summer on it. So I built this thing called
[13:19] KnightCite, a little citation editor on the web. It was free
[13:22] and I was really proud, I did it. I accomplished a lot
[13:25] of my goals. It supports all the major styleguides, dozens
[13:28] of sources (the only one that did that). Has an account
[13:31] system where you can login, create bibliographies, and export them
[13:34] It's got millions of users, and still to this day it's by
[13:37] far the most-used piece of software that I've ever written, and
[13:40] I made it all up as I went. I didn't read in a book how to do this
[13:43] I just had to figure out how to do a reset password
[13:46] thing, and I just figured it all out as I went. This, of course
[13:49] had some very minor downsides. Like, for instance, it's totally
[13:52] insecure.
[13:55] It's 100% manual testing
[13:58] It produces gigabytes of daily server warnings
[14:01] That those poor admins who still
[14:04] are, over a decade later, still dealing with
[14:07] and it's one 16,000 line-long PHP file
[14:10] of just if's and else's and string concatenation
[14:13] But
[14:16] what had happened to me in my classroom education was it had
[14:19] drilled into me this fear that I don't get what's going on
[14:22] and paralyzed me from ever practicing any of that creative
[14:25] reflex and that creative muscle. So recognizing
[14:28] that I needed a safe space where it was OK to make a mess
[14:31] and to do that in concert with learning proper
[14:34] computer science-y stuff was crucial
[14:37] to me even being in this profession
[14:40] much less on a stage, talking to you all about it. So that
[14:43] certainly lessened my sense of incompetence. The
[14:46] other thing at the time, the web was just a really fancy hypercard
[14:49] implementation. I didn't feel like a real developer; my friends all worked
[14:52] on airplane realtime controls and operating systems
[14:55] so the web versus being
[14:58] closer to the metal. Like, Uncle Bob told me—is Uncle Bob still
[15:01] here today, that you're not a real programmer
[15:04] unless you programmed assembly—well, I hadn't really programmed a lot of assembly
[15:07] So I didn't feel like a real programmer. And so I
[15:10] tried to go native at multiple points in my career
[15:13] Maybe on a Saturday, I'd open up Xcode and say, "I'm gonna build an OS X
[15:16] app", and i'd look at the documentation and it would confuse me and I'd feel
[15:19] stupid, and then I'd wait a weekend and I'd go, and I'd
[15:22] find a different part of the documentation and it'd depress me, and I'd feel
[15:25] stupid. And then the week after that I would open up Xcode and I'd
[15:28] look at a different part—and this outside in, like, "maybe if I just read it all
[15:31] and then I'll know how to make native apps." Of course, that didn't go well
[15:34] and time kept passing and I just concluded I was
[15:37] probably too dumb to make native apps, maybe I just had
[15:40] stay on the web. But then one day, a momentous day that a lot
[15:43] of us remember: the iPhone was announced. And I thought to myself
[15:46] as soon as this thing has an SDK, I'm gonna
[15:49] make an app. I really want to build something for
[15:52] the iPhone. The only problem was I had no idea what that would be. So I
[15:55] got the original iPhone and it changed
[15:58] my life, right? It was beautiful, obviously. It's innovative, there's nothing like it.
[16:01] I knew from the first day I had it that it was
[16:04] life-altering, because I took my wife to a restaurant and I ignored her the
[16:07] whole time. And I was, like, "this is
[16:10] the future!" Boy was I right
[16:13] So, the thing about that was I
[16:16] was staring so long, because Edge was so slow
[16:19] and I had this one gaming forum I liked to visit, and
[16:22] at first it was not very readable, but it took like
[16:25] 3 minutes to load a single page
[16:28] of what were often 50, 60 page-long threads
[16:31] so that was unacceptable. But there  was no such thing as
[16:34] the mobile web at the time. There's certainly no responsive
[16:37] design, and so I thought to myself, maybe I could build an app that was like a
[16:40] client to this website. Because I felt like the mobile web was a joke
[16:43] but I kept failing to learn Cocoa, and so maybe
[16:46] if I built something, I'd at least learn how to learn a
[16:49] really unfamiliar thing and tackle a new platform
[16:52] and I did it. So I started by building a little system that just
[16:55] go and fetch the HTML, and then I figured out how to load a library
[16:58] like libxml2 and parse all that into an object
[17:01] model, and then, you know, I'd find all the media in those
[17:04] objects and go and fetch them from the Internet, so I could build a
[17:07] UI and have a custom user interface in an iPhone app
[17:10] and you know what, it was way faster, and it was legible, and it was
[17:13] full-featured, you could log in and edit posts and stuff, it was really neat
[17:16] it was also the very first time I ever contributed to open source in a real
[17:19] way, and it was so
[17:22] cool, because every time that the Facebook app got launched, a
[17:25] little bit of my code ran, and when I realized the impact that I
[17:28] could have that way, I got addicted to sharing my stuff in
[17:31] open source. It was also my very first user group talk, and so
[17:34] the only reason I'm here today is because this one app happened to go well
[17:37] of course, it was rejected by Apple
[17:40] because, sometimes people swear on the Internet. And swearing
[17:43] was against the guidelines, which were very prudish at the time
[17:46] and so I threw it in the trash. But I didn't care
[17:49] I was happy as a clam, because mission accomplished: I'd learned how to learn a thing
[17:52] That was the real purpose for that exercise, and
[17:55] what I learned there was that learning something simple is pretty easy so
[17:58] long as you can fit it inside a day or whatever the bounds
[18:01] of that passion is, because it's enough to get
[18:04] through a weekend, but when the going gets tough, your motivation
[18:07] fizzles. If you try to learn something bigger, that's going to take several
[18:10] days, weeks, months, then you really need a purpose
[18:13] that's going to push you through those barriers as time
[18:16] goes on, or else you'll get distracted, you'll end up with just
[18:19] a graveyard of half-finished projects everywhere
[18:22] So what I try to do is find the smallest thing I can possibly
[18:25] caremad about. Really, like, "I need this project to exist
[18:28] and I'm going to just push and drag it over the finish line"
[18:31] And that was a lot of valuable lessons, and certainly
[18:34] made me feel less incompetent as a developer, because I got to go native
[18:37] For a long time, I did Java development
[18:40] and Java's a cool language, but I felt like it was
[18:43] a little uncool. It was
[18:46] certainly not getting a lot of buzz in the mid-aughts
[18:49] certainly not like Ruby was. A lot of my friends, they
[18:52] seemed really cool, they all worked on Ruby at work
[18:55] and the best way I can compare the two languages is via
[18:58] Super Mario Kart. You might think of Java
[19:01] as being like one of the early courses, just like a really
[19:04] wide lane and you can't really mess up that badly
[19:07] If you go off the course, you can just drive back
[19:10] on and we get that with Java, because it's not a
[19:13] very expressive language. The compiler does a lot for you
[19:16] the tools do a lot for you. Ruby is more like Rainbow Road
[19:19] where it's narrower and faster
[19:22] and if you fall off, Lakitu has to pick you up
[19:25] and you lose like 20 seconds, and that's reflective of
[19:28] dynamic programming and metaprogramming and how
[19:31] you don't have the same amazing tooling. And so programming
[19:34] even at this point in my career, I felt like I wasn't a very good programmer
[19:37] much less dynamic programming. And at the time
[19:40] in Ruby, meta-programming— changing at runtime the
[19:43] object model, the classes and method definitions
[19:46] I didn't even understand how that could possibly work. So I joined
[19:49] my first Ruby team completely terrified and surrounded by people who
[19:52] were way cooler than me and I thought "I have nothing to contribute
[19:55] here" until I looked at their test suite
[19:58] Because in Java, we had a pretty formal sense of what
[20:01] good tests looked like, and I knew that Rubyists wrote a lot of tests
[20:04] But it turns out that they all sucked, and so when I looked
[20:07] at those tests, I thought maybe this is a way for me to sneak in
[20:10] the back door and actually be relevant. I looked at a test like this
[20:13] This is creating a fake dog object and it's saying
[20:16] the dog should be called with the method wag and the argument tail
[20:19] and then you pass the dog to your subject under test
[20:22] and this just looked way wrong to me. First, there's no type awareness
[20:25] so you don't know that dog actually responds to wag. Then
[20:28] these things are out of order. It's like given-then-when and that feels
[20:31] awkward. And the API for making that
[20:34] test double and stubbing it was kinda confiusing, so
[20:37] I got caremad enough to say maybe
[20:40] I hate these mock objects, but if I
[20:43] can't metaprogram Ruby, I can't build something to replace them
[20:46] so maybe if I build it, I'll at least find a way to fit in
[20:49] as a Rubyist. And my whole goal here was just to
[20:52] cargo-cult my favorite test double library in Java and implement it
[20:55] in Ruby. And it turns out that that didn't work so well
[20:58] I learnedl some
[21:01] humility in the process that I had to go and actually talk to humans about
[21:04] the idioms and conventions in Ruby. I had to really bone up and learn
[21:07] how the Ruby object model worked. And then I had to put the time
[21:10] in. I took two weeks off for Christmas that year and I spent the whole time
[21:13] squirreled away just working on this, which my family
[21:16] didn't appreciate. And so what came
[21:19] out is this little fun gem called gimme. You pass it a type
[21:22] it's got the type awareness built-in. Here I pass it [to] the subject
[21:25] It's in the correct order. Here you can say you verify that the
[21:28] dog's called with wag and tail in a way that looks like a method
[21:31] invocation. And so I was really proud because this had the type awareness I was looking
[21:34] for. It preserves the test order. Has a clever, terse Ruby
[21:37] like API. Of course, no one adopted it, because nobody
[21:40] knew who I was, but I shopped it around at a couple conferences and got people
[21:43] like Jim Weirich to incorporate this style into Flexmock
[21:46] and now RSpec—which was the first example—
[21:49] has incorporated the same style. So I was able to kind-of move
[21:52] the needle a little bit. But what that project taught me
[21:55] was it's important to get out of the line of fire, right?
[21:58] I don't want to try to
[22:01] learn how to metaprogram in the most important feature, because
[22:04] then I'm on the spot, and everyone's going to call me out as an imposter
[22:07] Meanwhile, I learned that working code
[22:10] can sell an idea way better than just nitpicking stuff
[22:13] if I just come to that team and say  "hey your tests suck, because I don't like this
[22:16] and this and this", they'd say "what, so?". But if you throw a keyboard at
[22:19] the problem and actually build something—a proof of concept—you can reframe the
[22:22] discussion around the concrete stuff, and that was how I was able to sell
[22:25] that idea. Additionally, if what you're selling is ideas
[22:28] the best part is they require no maintenance. Nobody is going to open up a GitHub
[22:31] issue at 3am on a Saturday because your idea stopped
[22:34] working and so it's true that thoughtleaders
[22:37] have more fun. So that made me certainly
[22:40] feel less incompetent. A little bit
[22:43] about my own sense of inadequacy and how I was able to deal with that
[22:46] I practice a thing called Midwestern programming
[22:49] So if this is the continental
[22:52] US, my general
[22:55] stereotyped perception is that people on the east coast, the developers
[22:58] there they have serious jobs. They work at universities doing
[23:01] high finance, it's very obviously valuable
[23:04] work because it creates a lot of money. And on the west coast, your apps
[23:07] obviously don't make any money, but they get a lot of attention and
[23:10] all the really, really
[23:13] popular snacklechat, and other stuff, everyone is sort of…
[23:16] but in the midwest, we do a lot of charts
[23:19] We have all these blue
[23:22] chip companies that have backend office apps that they need
[23:25] built that might only have three users, that might
[23:28] not be that exciting. So frankly, I'm just not
[23:31] great at cocktail parties, when I explain, "Oh, well we're building
[23:34] this system that participates in demand-response energy
[23:37] markets in various parts of the country", people… their eyes glaze
[23:40] over and I heard a certain amount of rockstar envy. I just wanted to build a cool
[23:43] thing that I could say in a sentence, people would know what I did
[23:46] so I felt like my work wasn't exciting, but I only really knew how to build
[23:49] enterprise stuff, so maybe if I built something that was just designed to
[23:52] go viral, I'd feel more appreciated
[23:55] There was a service called mustachify.me at the time. My friend Aidan
[23:58] wrote, and what you do is pass an image and then it would
[24:01] use face.com API and put mustaches on the faces
[24:04] and I thought "that was cool, but let's go bigger". Like, what could I
[24:07] build that leveraged this, so I made a Chrome extension called Must
[24:10] Stache. And my friend Cory and I wrote it
[24:13] and so basically we would just go to the mustachify service, replace
[24:16] all the images on every page in your browser with a mustachified one
[24:19] and we though this was really cool, we did it in like 3 hours
[24:22] posted to a forum at night, we went to bed. And then the next day we had like
[24:25] 3000 installs of Pro users so they were visiting 40
[24:28] pages an hour, or 42 images per tab and
[24:31] we did the back-of-the-napkin math to realize it was like 5 million requests per hour
[24:34] and we learned a valuable lesson
[24:37] on that first day. It's actually a popular meme right now called
[24:40] serverless architecture, because we just destroyed
[24:43] Aidan's poor dyno. So we had to go back to the drawing board
[24:46] and what we did was we rebuilt it but this time talking directly to the
[24:49] face.com API which did the facial recognition and got you JSON
[24:52] back. And then with that JSON we'd take our own image and
[24:55] then just rotate, transpose, and put it over the images ourselves
[24:58] And that was really fun. That was a fun weekend hack
[25:01] But I didn't get a ton of attention. In fact time passed
[25:04] I forgot all about this thing until I saw in the news that face.com
[25:07] was getting acquired for $80 Million by facebook
[25:10] that made me—that was surprising. So I went googling
[25:13] around my Must Stache thing and saw it had been covered in Tested
[25:16] it'd been covered in PC World in print. It
[25:19] was on the Verge. You know, the Glamour magazine wrote an article
[25:22] about this Chrome extension. And no one ever thought to contact me
[25:25] But I felt pretty
[25:28] proud that I'd had this impact. And pretty
[25:31] annoyed too when I thought about it. I looked at face.com's
[25:34] developer forums and almost all the posts were just people using my
[25:37] stupid Must Stache thing, and the developers at face.com were
[25:40] giving them active tech support. And I thought "but this is violating
[25:43] your terms of—ohhhhh, it's so that you hockey stick and can
[25:46] show off a ton of usage to Facebook, and I bet you a big
[25:49] part of that $80M valuation had something to do with
[25:52] my thing. Where's my cut? Well, my cut
[25:55] came in the form of face.com shutting down and then me getting a bunch of
[25:58] e-mail because all of a sudden, nobody's browser worked
[26:01] Because all of the images would just 404
[26:04] So that was cool. I built a popular
[26:07] thing, yay, but I didn't get to
[26:10] enjoy any of that popularity at all, and I may have
[26:13] made somebody else millions of dollars [citation
[26:16] needed]. But it feels
[26:19] that way and I made lots of users angry
[26:22] the only time they ever learned about me was after their stuff stopped
[26:25] working. And I was left with no recourse
[26:28] I didn't have time to build a new face.com, I just had to kind of
[26:31] shut down the extension. So I learned in the process
[26:34] serverless isn't. Obviously, if you depend on someone else's server
[26:37] they can always pull the rug out from you
[26:40] That was a valuable lesson. Also, chasing
[26:43] popularity without an underlying purpose or value statement is
[26:46] toxic. Because, when I did run into a problem, I didn't have
[26:49] the time—there was no economic reason or even moral reason
[26:52] for me to invest the time to fix it. I was just left, you know,
[26:55] with people angry at me. So that sucked.
[26:58] But! It did get covered, apparently,
[27:01] in the last season of HBO's Silicon Valley where
[27:04] they made an AR version of the plugin, so
[27:07] that made me feel pretty cool, I guess.
[27:10] Another way that I felt inadequate as a developer is that one time I was on this
[27:13] legacy rescue project. A big waterfall project. If you don't know these
[27:16] terms, by the way, legacy when we use that in software terms
[27:19] it means that your kids will inherit it
[27:22] and rescue means that you want to be rescued
[27:25] So I was on this project for months
[27:28] I could barely—my computer was just a memory
[27:31] at this point, because I hadn't programmed in so long, I'd forgotten how to program
[27:34] I felt like, "could I even program anything in 2 months anymore?"
[27:37] I was really feeling kind of despondent and out of touch with myself as a
[27:40] craftsperson. And at the time the
[27:43] to-do apps were undergoing this renaissance, because it was still
[27:46] early in the App Store and there was all these new to-do apps and I didn't really like any
[27:49] of them. I kept falling back on this plaintext thing that I did where
[27:52] I'd define a project with a colon, and I'd dasherize tasks
[27:55] and I'd indicate something's done with a slash or blocked
[27:58] with a pound sign, or I'd date it with braces and I
[28:01] would just do this instead of using an app, but of course that was inconvenient
[28:04] So I was thinking at the time, I feel like I hate all these
[28:07] to-do apps, but I've also forgotten how to code so I can't
[28:10] built my own. But maybe if I were to try I'd at least be able to restore my
[28:13] dignity as a developer. And what I had to do there was I could give myself
[28:16] the constraints needed and so I gave myself a little quest
[28:19] I said "I want to build a to-do app that's so great
[28:22] that I will use this at the exclusion of all the others…
[28:25] and I only want to give myself 24 hours."
[28:28] Can I still hack it? Under pressure.
[28:31] So I built this app called doing-it.
[28:34] So in doing-it, you define a project. And I started by just saying
[28:37] throw all the content in a div, [make it] contenteditable
[28:40] dump it into localStorage, read it from localStorage
[28:43] and then use the tool to track the rest of the work in the tool
[28:46] So I was using doing-it to build doing-it from like minute
[28:49] 40. So I did it, I built the thing. It's still up at
[28:52] todo.testdouble.com if you want to check it out you can
[28:55] make a project, it'll autoformat based on the
[28:58] the lead character here, so this is me making a couple different things
[29:01] I can mark them done or overdue or high priority
[29:04] and mark'em all done. And that was a lot of fun, you know I finished it within the
[29:07] 1 day. Gave me a renewed sense of confidence as a developer
[29:10] It still works, thanks to Heroku's free dynos
[29:13] No users, so no angry e-mails to
[29:16] deal with. That was nice. And I just threw it up on GitHub
[29:19] Because that's just the default thing, I just work in the open
[29:22] But the purpose of course was just self-validataion that's what
[29:25] I wanted to prove myself I could still program, but when I throw
[29:28] stuff out into the open, that's just because that's my default, it's not because
[29:31] I'm necessarily trying to become an open source star. But I do
[29:34] get a lot of people—because I do a lot of open source—come to me and say
[29:37] "How do I get into open source", and I think that maintainers struggle with this
[29:40] question, because they want to make it sound easy to get involved
[29:43] They might say, "write me some docs" or "Send me a
[29:46] small pull request or something", and the problem with that of course is that
[29:49] it's not the normal creative exchange of ideas. You might
[29:52] even submit the pull request, but then most of the time that maintainer
[29:55] is gonna get angry and say "this isn't how I'd do it—rejected!"
[29:58] or "Change it!" and nobody needs another boss
[30:01] right? So if you get into open source
[30:04] to be creative, you just create stuff instead
[30:07] Because, when you go and talk to open source maintainers, like "how did you get started
[30:10] with open source," it was rarely "oh, I started doing docs for this
[30:13] one other guy. It was usually "well, I made stuff that I
[30:16] wanted, I threw it up on the Internet, and then some of it got popular
[30:19] and most of it didn't." And you'll never predict what's
[30:22] gonna stick and what's not. The reference to 200 repos is that I've probably
[30:25] got like 250 repos that I've started and you've—
[30:28] —odds are you've heard of zero of them. You may have heard of two or
[30:31] three. But the vast majority is stuff that I just built
[30:34] just for the sake of it, and I don't expect to hear about it again
[30:37] And it might seem scary to work in the open, like
[30:40] you know, people are going to criticize your code, but there's a secret:
[30:43] nobody reads code. So
[30:46] just don't worry about that. I'm not going to read your code
[30:49] So that made me feel a little bit less inadequate
[30:52] as a developer. Third one, now that I'm a self-professed
[30:55] thoughtleader who talks at conferences a bunch, most
[30:58] thoughtleaders get into this line of work, by doing something
[31:01] interesting, or observing something interesting. Sharing that insight with
[31:04] other people. But then eventually, you stop doing
[31:07] the work, and you run the risk of thoughtleading other people straight off
[31:10] a cliff. And you don't want to do that
[31:13] When it comes to test-driven development, I talk about test-driven development
[31:16] a lot. I've talked about it for more years than I've practiced
[31:19] it, which is worrying. And one day I decided to start leading
[31:22] some thoughts about test-driven development. In fact, if you google
[31:25] the phrase tdd failure, this blog post is the top
[31:28] result, which I"m particularly proud of
[31:31] And I got a lot of attention. And it was the front-page of Hacker News and I was
[31:34] in the article I was saying "well this is what London-school test-driven development
[31:37] is", and then the guy who actually invented that, Nat Pryce, was like
[31:40] "no, it's not, really", and I was like "But I just got 400
[31:43] thousand page views saying it was" and now everyone's going to find out that I'm a big
[31:46] idiot. And so I was really upset about that, but
[31:49] then, being the opportunistic and
[31:52] person just seeking the
[31:55] validation of everyone else, I decided to pivot and instead
[31:58] just rename what I do as its own thing, so I
[32:01] call it "Discovery Testing" and I actually built libraries
[32:04] and talks around how to practice Discovery Testing as its own school
[32:07] of TDD. So much so, that I realized I give a lot of talks
[32:10] but I hadn't actually practiced it much
[32:13] and I was just full of hot air. And so I felt like TDD, of course
[32:16] it's not very well understood. A lot of us try it and fail
[32:19] or don't really learn how to apply it consistently, so there's stuff
[32:22] to say here, but I've just become a talking head at this point
[32:25] And so I realized this last summer, maybe I need to
[32:28] start practicing this more on my own and really proving out
[32:31] that it really works. I've gotta validate my ideas. So I've got this
[32:34] Simplisafe alarm system. It's just a thing where you
[32:37] stick it to the wall, and if a door
[32:40] opens, an alarm goes off, police come to your house. Simple alarm monitoring
[32:43] And I love Apple's HomeKit, because I really love this idea
[32:46] of a smart home, like we learned today the Internet of Things
[32:49] aside from denial of service attacks
[32:52] is also useful for just the convenience
[32:55] of controlling your domain. So I have this server called
[32:58] homebridge, runs Node.js and
[33:01] you can build adapters, so I was thinking I'll build an adapter for Simplisafe
[33:04] So that when I'm on my couch I can say "hey Siri, turn on my alarm"
[33:07] The idea being, of course, I'd spend 40 hours building
[33:10] a thing to save myself 8 seconds the 3 or 4 times that I think
[33:13] to use the thing, because programming.
[33:16] So the question was: what's this thing in the middle? How do I
[33:19] build an adapter? The truth is I had no idea how to build this, and that's
[33:22] purportedly what my practice of test- driven development, Discovery Testing
[33:25] does. So does my process actually work? And so I actually
[33:28] experimented, and several hours in I was very
[33:31] relieved to find that I could build a thing and that it actually worked
[33:34] So there's this npm module now exists, simplisafe and it's got
[33:37] a simple little API. You pass it credentials, you get a
[33:40] client back, you can set the state. What was funny was I TDD'd
[33:43] this, right, so I was writing tests. And the only credentials I had were the ones
[33:46] to my house. And so I had to be really careful in the failure states, because I
[33:49] didn't want to send the cops to my house by accident
[33:52] And in particular, this got really
[33:55] confusing with Travis [CI], because I would upload it to Travis
[33:58] continuous integration, and people would send pull requests and it would
[34:01] change the beeping in my house and I'd have to make sure all the doors were shut
[34:07] But the lesson I learned there, I followed
[34:10] my own advice and really practice it. I was relieved to see that it
[34:13] went well. But honestly, I'm kind of ashamed because I went so long without validating
[34:16] my ideas. And you guys, just by having
[34:19] me here today, have given me a platform and I don't want to
[34:22] abuse it by just being a talking head. I want to make sure that everything I
[34:25] share can potentially really help you grow in your career
[34:28] So that was a valuable lesson and I think
[34:31] we can apply it to managers, like technical
[34:34] managers, former developers, what I've
[34:37] been able to generalize from my experience, especially at Test Double, is that everything
[34:40] at a distance seems simpler. The people
[34:43] actually doing the work, when a developer says this is going to take several more weeks, they're
[34:46] closer to it, they see all the complexity, which is easy
[34:49] to just hand-wave away when you're operating at a distance
[34:52] Additionally, when you have a lot of experience, you tend to
[34:55] —we're all pattern-recognition machines and you feed in all these problems and somebody might
[34:58] feed you a problem, and you might say "well, yeah, that looks like the 15 other
[35:01] things that I did." And you come up with this round, polished idealistic
[35:04] solution. But, of course, that's not going to actually map very closely
[35:07] to that individual's context. You have to actually trust the people
[35:10] closest to the work.
[35:13] And so that's been a humbling exercise in a manager role, to not
[35:16] just jump to conclusions that I always know best.
[35:19] But nonetheless, that was also helpful in me dealing
[35:22] with my own sense of inadequacy as I merge into this
[35:25] more management role. Let's talk a little bit about indignation
[35:28] First of all, I'm a big worrier
[35:31] Todd, mentioned I'm really high anxiety. I worry about
[35:34] banks, and credit card statements, and finances, and stuff
[35:37] and I really wanted a dashboard to handle this all for me and Mint
[35:40] was that for a long time. I'd use Mint, I'd see all my finances
[35:43] were still there, and I'd feel good. But
[35:46] six years in, I had this random thought: you know I wonder how Mint
[35:49] is actually secure? How does it actually securely go and get all these
[35:52] services? And get all my account updates?
[35:55] Of course, what I figured out was that it's just not secure
[35:58] it has decryptable versions of all of your passwords
[36:01] to all of your banking stuff and doesn't support two-factor auth or anything like
[36:04] that. And that's kind of worrisome. It's actually a very popular Internet
[36:07] cloud architecture right now called SPoFaaS.
[36:10] If you're not familiar with SPoFaaS, it stands for single point of failure as a service
[36:16] Another thing we're learning about today, too, with the Internet outage
[36:19] So, Mint, Yodlee, if they go away
[36:22] then all of your stuff just disappears. You're just giving
[36:25] a single point of failure for them to take all your money. So I was stewing on this
[36:28] I got angry. I was trying to figure out how do I get off Mint.
[36:31] Sure, I could cancel it, but I want to replace it with something better. What could I build
[36:34] So I thought: security matters.
[36:37] But I'm not an expert. I'm not going to build the next Mint or Yodlee
[36:40] and solve this very difficult distribution problem, but I could probably
[36:43] just build something for myself and at least personally feel a
[36:46] little bit safer. And so I built this gem that I call fine_ants
[36:52] In fine_ants you build adapters. So here's an adapter to Vanguard
[36:55] I pass it credentials. And because I can run it locally, I can
[36:58] actually do two-factor auth in my terminal, so I have two-factor auth set up
[37:01] now. And it just downloads all my holdings for all my Vanguard accounts
[37:04] And I built a little Rails app for it too that
[37:07] runs at localhost, and so it's encrypted on my disk
[37:10] And it shows me all of my account holdings and I click that button and it
[37:13] launches a Selenium worker to go and
[37:16] open browsers to go to all of my banks and stuff
[37:19] And I was really proud, because now I've almost got this dashboard that I wanted
[37:22] It's locally-encrypted. It's as safe as running it from my own browser
[37:25] Puts Selenium for good use to once, instead of just
[37:28] really brittle integration tests, and
[37:31] and, you know, admitting it's
[37:34] not a generalizable app. I mean, you can go and find this stuff on
[37:37] GitHub and clone it yourself and run it yourself, and I'd encourage you to try it
[37:40] But it's not going to be the next unicorn, billion
[37:43] dollar company. But, honestly, there's no shame in hobby
[37:46] grade. A lot of times, we're talking about creativity, right? We're talking about
[37:49] building stuff. And sometimes just solving your own
[37:52] problem is enough. Like these little toy apps like this are often
[37:55] what got us into programming in the first place, even if you're just
[37:58] solving your own problem, there's no shame in that. So that
[38:01] made me feel a little bit less furious
[38:04] at the world. Another example, so
[38:07] Test Double, our company, right. I've already referred—I used
[38:10] the term "test double" a few times, but some of you may not know it. That library
[38:13] gimme is actually an example of a test double library. If you don't
[38:16] know the term, the word "test double" is supposed to evoke the image of a
[38:19] stunt double. But not like a stunt driver in a plane, like
[38:22] a stand-in for your tests. So assume you like, maybe
[38:25] your app depends on the cloud, so you have to fake that out to make your
[38:28] test pass. Well, whatever you did to fake out the cloud is probably
[38:31] an example of a test double that fakes that service out
[38:34] And in JavaScript, the most popular test double
[38:37] library is called Sinon. But when
[38:40] I see people use Sinon, most of them don't understand it very well
[38:43] Because it's kind of confusing. A lot of people get frustrated
[38:46] because it's a huge API, or just angry at the
[38:49] fact it's not very opinionated. So I've given
[38:52] a lot of thought to making something better than Sinon in JavaScript
[38:55] And I decided, you know, a lot of users
[38:58] that use Sinon are in pain, but I have to admit I
[39:01] can't beat it. It's got like 2 million downloads a month
[39:04] But if I build something at least I'll be less grouchy and at least I'll
[39:07] have something to hand somebody instead of just more snark
[39:10] and whining. And so it was humbling, right, because
[39:13] I've built now—this is like the 4th or 5th test double
[39:16] library in a different language that I've built and I keep coming back to the same
[39:19] saw over and over again. And it's humbling to think
[39:22] that my entire career may well hinge on just
[39:25] two or three concepts and I keep repeating them, because
[39:28] I learn, because I'm passionate about it, and then I build
[39:31] something and then I share it, and then I feed back into learning more
[39:34] and it's this infinite loop of me iterating over time on just a handful
[39:37] of issues, and with Test Double, we're able to
[39:40] do that again by building testdouble.js. You can install it on
[39:43] npm. To get the npm install, and
[39:46] the npm package "testdouble" it works on the frontend and the backend
[39:49] There's a screencast on our website called happier tdd with
[39:52] testdouble.js you can go watch. We've also got a comparison
[39:55] blog post of testdouble vs. sinon and
[39:58] what was cool about testdouble is it works, but it
[40:01] most importantly, shares all of our opinions about what we've learned
[40:04] about test double libraries and good isolation testing over the years
[40:07] And it's certainly better than just being cynical and snarky
[40:10] about "oh, JavaScript sucks" or "JavaScript testing is this or that"
[40:13] A lesson I learned early on is that if
[40:16] your message isn't getting through to somebody and they're not hearing
[40:19] what you're trying to say, you can conclude one of two things:
[40:22] you can either conclude that they're a bozo for not understanding
[40:25] you, or that there's something with how you're trying to communicate that's
[40:28] failing to convey to them. And if you conclude that they're a bozo
[40:31] that's it. You just
[40:34] disengage, right? There's no next step. But
[40:37] I always assume it's something wrong in how I'm
[40:40] trying to communicate, and so I'm always iterating on my message
[40:43] and only as a very last possibility do I assume it's
[40:46] the listener's fault, because I can't control that at all
[40:49] And also, for your library
[40:52] to win, not everything else has to lose. Sometimes just doing something that's
[40:55] useful for a small group is plenty. Especially if you're able to communicate
[40:58] ideas in a way that moves other people forward
[41:01] in how they think about something. And certainly criticism
[41:04] is easier than contribution. It's really easy
[41:07] to be snarky on Twitter and say something sucks, but
[41:10] Christian Johansson who made Sinon, he put himself
[41:13] out there and it has served a lot of people really well
[41:16] and he's a really really nice guy, but I
[41:19] spent like two years just shitting on his work on twitter before
[41:22] I thought "maybe I should just build something that serves my needs
[41:25] instead." So building
[41:28] that certainly made me a little less angry about JavaScript testing.
[41:31] Another thing you may have noticed is that I like emoji
[41:34] I've used a few of them
[41:37] in the slides
[41:40] And creativity, open source stuff, can sometimes feel
[41:43] a little too self-serious and open source feels "you create,
[41:46] we depend." Other people start to pull your stuff
[41:49] and then all of a sudden they're really demanding
[41:52] and it usually starts with: you have an idea, you want to build a thing
[41:55] and it's a labor of love and it brings you joy, but then
[41:58] eventually companies start depending on it, and criticizing
[42:01] or opening issues or acting entitled and trying to get stuff out
[42:04] of you for free and that's a big bummer. In fact I know a lot of open
[42:07] source maintainers and what's super consistent
[42:10] is that they tend to hate their creations in
[42:13] proportion to how popular they are, and that just
[42:16] seems totally backwards. So I was feeling
[42:19] kind of exploited and exhausted at this particular point
[42:22] in my career. But I can't just escape open source, I'm not going to
[42:25] ragequit GitHub and delete all my stuff and yank all my stuff
[42:28] and take my ball and go home. So maybe if I just build something
[42:31] new, something fresh, I'll find a fresh start. And the way I did it was, I
[42:34] decided I was going to build something that no business could ever want
[42:37] To just be creative
[42:40] for the sake of creativity. And sometimes, even still, if I build something
[42:43] that I worry that a business might exploit, might
[42:46] build a business around and cut me out, I'll just license it
[42:49] GPL as if troll them, because then that way they have to come
[42:52] to me to obtain a commercial license
[42:55] This is such a project. I think it is
[42:58] GPL'd, called emoruby. So there's not a lot of transpilers
[43:01] for the Ruby language, but this one transpiles emoji
[43:04] into Ruby code. So here's an example file
[43:07] listing of emoruby. This is a class called Heart,
[43:10] defining a method called wave, printing out a statement saying hello
[43:13] and ending those two things. And then
[43:16] Instantiating the heart and calling wave
[43:19] So this, if you're not familiar with emoruby, this
[43:22] translates to this ruby here, and it totally works
[43:25] And it was a lot of fun. So tl;dr what I learned
[43:28] on emoruby is that it's super dumb, it's
[43:31] just there for fun, it's just there to be joyful. I actually got a lot of
[43:34] contributors on it, because they found fun in trying to map
[43:37] different keywords and control- flow structures to what
[43:40] emoji should that be. But it brought me a lot of joy
[43:43] and it's had zero issues opened against it this year
[43:46] So it's one of my favorite projects. It's okay to just build stuff for
[43:49] yourself. I know some of you are developers here and you're here with your managers,
[43:52] hoping they're not looking over your shoulder right now: it's actually OK just
[43:55] to build things for fun. The joy of programming is like
[43:58] really undervalued and we get too self-serious about our craft
[44:01] So that helped lessen
[44:04] my sense of indignation. Looking back on all this stuff
[44:07] is—I wouldn't recognize myself
[44:10] ten years ago, I think, because all of this
[44:13] these creative exercises have really changed me as a person and I've actually
[44:16] found a way to mature and grow up, and
[44:19] I see you there, I'm saying "hey look creative stuff, this is easy" but I've
[44:22] also just lambasted you with 12 years of side projects
[44:25] and "look at me! look at me! This is a cool thing I built!" I understand
[44:28] that might make the bar feel higher, and you know what
[44:31] maybe you're right, because it's true that creativity is not for everyone. Here's a
[44:34] quick litmus test if you're perfectly
[44:37] content. And you're totally fulfilled. And you're OK with
[44:40] the status quo, then why would you want to change things? You're right, maybe
[44:43] you aren't a creative type. You should just enjoy the beach that you guys have
[44:46] not too far from here. But if you have any negative
[44:49] feelings at all, our culture right now, we tend to pathologize
[44:52] negative feelings as themselves being bad, but often they're just a
[44:55] symptom of some different root cause, and if you analyze and
[44:58] you're open about that with yourself, you might find that what's
[45:01] really bothering you is that you're using the wrong tool for the job, or
[45:04] there's friction between the technologies and the practices that you're using
[45:07] or work can't offer you what you need, or maybe you just have your own internal
[45:10] baggage that you need to get over. And creativity can be a great outlet
[45:13] for those kind of root cause problems. And if you reflect
[45:16] on how you feel and you feed—you accept—
[45:19] those emotions, what's funny is our asynchronous brain will just
[45:22] start spitting out ideas and it'll be a big idea generator
[45:25] and hopefully, you'll find a way to exercise it.
[45:28] And when I tell you, like when you
[45:31] feel confused, or when you feel down, or
[45:34] upset or scared, all
[45:37] of those emotions are the place where all the good stuff
[45:40] comes from. Great ideas don't come from people who've
[45:43] already got everything figured out, and
[45:46] when the bar's that low, you fling over it and hopefully
[45:49] wind up in a better place. The important thing is you've gotta find your outlet
[45:52] And I don't know what that outlet is for everybody
[45:55] In fact it's important for me to mention that that outlet might not have anything
[45:58] to do with software. Certainly, if
[46:01] my outlet for creativity wasn't software,
[46:04] my wrists wouldn't hurt as much and I'd probably get more sun and I'd be in better shape
[46:07] So find what that outlet
[46:10] is for you, because it may or may not have anything to do with software
[46:13] Tomorrow, I was here last year, and the day after SCNA
[46:16] was one of my favorite days last year, because I just sat
[46:19] on Manhattan beach and watched football and drank with Big Ten football
[46:22] from 9am to 3pm which is something I can't do in the
[46:25] eastern time zone, so that was really cool. But tomorrow tomorrow,
[46:28] we're going to have even more fun, because we're going to be here
[46:31] programming stuff. Todd
[46:34] my partner and I, we're going to join forces tomorrow and we're doing
[46:37] what we call a "test smells", like "code smells" workshop
[46:40] it's a really fun, engaging thing where we all talk
[46:43] together about things about testing that we hate
[46:46] I hope that you come and join, and what we do is
[46:49] listen to stories, and we've got this repository of
[46:52] 30 different types of problematic tests, work through
[46:55] those examples and really kind of bring a name to a lot of the different
[46:58] antipatterns that we find in tests. I hope that you'll join us, it's a really
[47:01] really fun exercise, and it's going to be happening kind of coincident
[47:04] with the code retreat and what other activities we have
[47:07] tomorrow. So again, my name's @searls
[47:10] or Justin, you can call me whatever you like
[47:13] I hope you tell me on Twitter what you thought of this talk, any feedback
[47:16] you have. Like I mentioned, we're here to
[47:19] fix the software industry and to do that we're gonna
[47:22] need creative people who want to creatively solve those problems and help
[47:25] inspire that in others. If you're interested in joining, our
[47:28] team I hope you'll contact us. And if you know any
[47:31] teams that are looking for that slack. Looking for some
[47:34] outside inspiration, we're always looking for
[47:37] additional clients that we can work with. You can reach us at hello@testdouble.com
[47:40] or find me or Todd tonight or tomorrow, we'd love to talk to you
[47:43] Also got a lot of stickers and business cards we'd like to share
[47:46] But, you know, you've been super patient. Like Todd
[47:49] mentioned, I'm the only one standing between you and free drinks
[47:52] and nobody got up and left, so that's
[47:55] really humbling. Thank you so much for your time today.
